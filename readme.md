Inspired from real-world Brainf**k, we want to create an interpreter of that language which will support the following instructions (the machine memory or 'data' should behave like a potentially infinite array of bytes, initialized to 0):

`>` increment the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the right).
`<` decrement the data pointer (to point to the next cell to the left).
`+` increment (increase by one, truncate overflow: 255 + 1 = 0) the byte at the data pointer.
`-` decrement (decrease by one, treat as unsigned byte: 0 - 1 = 255 ) the byte at the data pointer.
`.` output the byte at the data pointer.
`,` accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the data pointer.
`[` if the byte at the data pointer is zero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it forward to the command after the matching ] command.
`]` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero, then instead of moving the instruction pointer forward to the next command, jump it back to the command after the matching [ command.
The function will take in input...

the program code, a string with the sequence of machine instructions,
the program input, a string, eventually empty, that will be interpreted as an array of bytes using each character's ASCII code and will be consumed by the `,` instruction
... and will return ...

the output of the interpreted code (always as a string), produced by the `.` instruction.
