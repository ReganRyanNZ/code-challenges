#Code Challenges

I love code challenges, and current frequent codewars.com

I think these challenges not only stimulate thinking and learning, but I may end up writing code that could be used later. With this in mind, I created this repo to store answers I think have particular merit.

Due to the nature of the challenges you won't see a lot of OOP, or much structure at all. Instead most solutions are within a single method, and focus more on the algorithm at hand.
